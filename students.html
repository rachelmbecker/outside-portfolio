        <h2>I teach two courses at UMSI</h2>
        <p> <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/courses/608">SI 608: Networks</a> - covers topics in network analysis, from social networks to applications in information networks such as the internet. We introduce basic concepts in network theory, discuss metric and models, use software analysis tools to experiment with a wide variety of real-world network data, and study applications to areas such as information retrieval.</p>
        <p> <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/programs/courses/618">SI 618: Data Manipulation and Analysis</a> - aims to help students get started with their own data harvesting, processing, aggregation, and analysis. We cover a wide variety of topics such as using APIs to collect data, SQL, Spark through Python. We use R to perform exploratory data analysis. We use DataCamp for lab assignments for this part of the class so that our students can learn R in an interactive way.</p>
        <p> Prospective PhD students must first be admitted to UMSI's PhD program before they can work with an individual advisor. If you are interested in working with me, please first apply to our program and then drop me an email. Undergraduate and Masters students who have already been admitted to the University of Michigan and are interested in working on computational social science problems are welcome to contact me. Include your interests, degree, major, and resume in your email.</p>
